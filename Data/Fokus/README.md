#Brief description of the data - Best places to live:
 
The data consist of a ranking of Sweden’s 290 municipalities. The ranking is based on the mean of 45 variables that are indexed. The variables are selected by us (together with [Charlotta Mellander and her team](http://hj.se/jibs/forskning/personer/charlotta-mellander.html)) and are checked if they covary with moving patterns. The variables are a mix of pure demographics, statistics of municipal services and other measurable stuff about the municipalities.
 
We also group some of these variables and create new indices, which we name: Best places to be young, Best places to be old, Best places to have a family, Best places to work.

For example: Best to be young is based upon 7 variables: net immigration of 15-24yr olds, share of 18-25yr olds of tot pop, no of uni teachers, no of apt buildings, no entertainment venues, no employed in entertainment businesses, youth unemployment.  
The variables in the main index that are not used constitute the category named “fundamental values”.
 
The municipalities can be divided into four subgroups, based on their size and geographical location: 

1. Big city (the municipalities in and around Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö). 
2. City (muni. with pop >30’ and/or where the biggest town in that muni has pop>25’ plus muni surrounding these with commuting >50’), 
3. Countryside (muni with pop density>5 prs / km2 and is not a Big City or City muni), 
4. Rural (muni with pop density<5 prs / km2 and is not a Big City or City muni).
